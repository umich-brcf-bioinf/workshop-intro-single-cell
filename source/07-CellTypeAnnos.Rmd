# Introduction

A frequent bottleneck in the single-cell RNA-seq analysis workflow is annotating our clustering results, as it requires bridging the gap between the data and prior knowledge ([source](https://bioconductor.org/books/3.15/OSCA.basic/cell-type-annotation.html)). While generating markers for each cluster and evaluating the expression of known marker genes is important, it may or may not be sufficient to assign cell-type or sub-type labels. 

<table class='fig'>
<tr class='fig'><td class='fig'>![](images/graphical_abstracts/graphical_abstract_annotation.png)</td></tr>
<tr class='fig'><td class='fig'>For each cell-type (A), the marker genes we derived in the prior step (B) are compared with known marker genes for different cell types (C). Concordance between derived marker genes and known cell markers produces a suggested annotation for that cell type.
</td></tr>
</table>

In this section, our goal is to use an automated annotation tool to generate cell type predictions for our clusters. 

Like the previous sections, the process to assign cell-types to clusters can be very iterative. In addition, the steps to reach a "Figure 1" level of labeled clusters may not be presented in detail, can be very dataset dependent, and often is more challenging for less characterized tissues. 

## Objectives

-  Understand the complexities of cell-type annotation    
-  Use `scCATCH` cell-type predictions to annotate our clusters

# Cell type predictions

Automated tools have the advantage of being able to compare between the expression patterns in our dataset and large numbers of reference datasets or databases at a scale that is not feasible to do manually.

As described [in more detail by the Ouyang Lab](https://ouyanglab.com/singlecell/clust.html#annotating-clusters) and summarized in the figure below, there are many computational tools that aim to assign cell type labels for single-cell data. These methods generally fall into three categories: 

1. Marker based approaches that use gene sets drawn from the literature, including previous single-cell studies, 
2. Correlation based approaches that estimate the similarity between the cells or clusters in the input data and some reference data
3. Machine learning approaches that include training on a single-cell reference atlas. 

![Image: Diagram of types of cell annotation approaches (from Oyang materials).](./images/curriculum/07-CellTypeAnnotation/Ouyang_clust-celltype.png)   

However, across any of these approaches the quality of the reference data (and reliability of the authors labels) and relevancy to your specific tissue/experiment (and the resolution of your biological question) is crucial. Additionally, it's important to consider that rare or novel cell populations may not be present or well-characterized in available references and that even after filtering, some clusters might correspond to stressed or dying cells and not a particular cell-type or subtype. Therefore, any prediction should be reviewed and considered in the context both marker gene expression for the dataset and knowledge of the biological system and broader literature. 

Some tools and references are available solely or primarily for human tissues (and not mouse or rat), particular for tissues other than PBMCs and the brain. For human data, if a relevant reference is available for your experiment, we would recommend trying [Azimuth (created by authors of Seurat)](https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/). [10x has a tutorial](https://www.10xgenomics.com/analysis-guides/automated-cell-type-annotation-from-r-to-loupe-using-louper) that includes example of using Azimuth, including a feature of the tool that allows for first pass of cell-type assignment of more common cell-types followed by identifying rarer populations that may not be identified in the first pass.

# Using scCATCH

A tool we often use for both mouse and human data cell-type predictions is called [scCATCH](https://github.com/ZJUFanLab/scCATCH/wiki) which, per the author's description in [Shao et al (2020)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7031312/), annotates cell-types using a "tissue-specific cellular taxonomy reference database (CellMatch) and [an] evidence-based scoring (ES) protocol". The CellMatch reference is compiled from CellMarker ([Zhang et al., 2019b](https://www.cell.com/servlet/linkout?suffix=e_1_5_1_2_33_2&dbid=8&doi=10.1016/j.isci.2020.100882&key=30289549&cf=)), MCA ([Han et al., 2018](https://www.cell.com/servlet/linkout?suffix=e_1_5_1_2_10_2&dbid=8&doi=10.1016/j.isci.2020.100882&key=29775597&cf=)), CancerSEA ([Yuan et al., 2019](https://www.cell.com/servlet/linkout?suffix=e_1_5_1_2_29_2&dbid=8&doi=10.1016/j.isci.2020.100882&key=30329142&cf=)), and the [CD Marker Handbook](https://www.abcam.com/primary-antibodies/human-cd-antigen-guide) and PMIDs for relevant literature are reported in the prediction results. 

<!-- consider adding [scType](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scCATCH/vignettes/tutorial.html) as an alternative -->

![Image: scCATCH summary from Shao et al (2020).](./images/curriculum/07-CellTypeAnnotation/scCATCH-paper-VizAbstract.jpeg) 

First, we need to load the scCATCH library. Then, we'll double check that we are using the expected resolution cluster results (this is particularly important if we generated multiple resolutions in our clustering steps), before creating a new object from our `counts` data with `createscCATCH()` and adding our marker genes to the scCATCCH object.

To increase the speed and accuracy of our predictions, we'll create query of relevant tissues (which requires some prior knowledge of the experiment and using the [scCATCH wiki](https://github.com/ZJUFanLab/scCATCH/wiki) to select tissues from the species) before we run the tool:

```{r, sccatch, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Annotate clusters using scCATCH  ----------------------------------------
library(scCATCH)

# check that cell identities are set to expected resolution 
all(Idents(geo_so) == geo_so$integrated.sct.rpca.clusters)

# create scCATCH object, using count data
geo_catch = createscCATCH(data = geo_so@assays$SCT@counts, cluster = as.character(Idents(geo_so)))

# add marker genes to use for predictions
geo_catch@markergene = geo_markers

# specify tissues/cell-types from the scCATCH reference
geo_catch@marker = cellmatch[cellmatch$species == 'Mouse' & cellmatch$tissue %in% c('Blood', 'Peripheral Blood', 'Muscle', 'Skeletal muscle', 'Epidermis', 'Skin'), ]

# run scCATCH to generate predictions
geo_catch = findcelltype(geo_catch)

# look at the predictions
geo_catch@celltype %>% select(cluster, cell_type, celltype_score)
```

When we look at our results we can see the cell type score, which gives us an idea of the confidence of that prediction. Not shown here but the full `celltype` table also includes marker genes and PMIDs for relevant literature for each prediction.

In our experience, these kinds of results often help guide cluster annotation but scores can vary and the predictions may need to be revised based on researcher's knowledge of the biological system. As these cell-types correspond to the cell-types and subtypes we'd expect to be present in these data and most of the prediction scores are quite high, we can reasonably use these results to annotate our clusters with some minor adjustments. 

To confirm, we'll spot check some known markers for immune populations. Then we'll look look at some other key marker genes from the original [Sorkin et al (2020) paper](), as well as some other resrouces like [Li et al (2022)](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-022-04817-5/figures/2) and [Nestorowa et al (2016)](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/128/8/e20/35749/A-single-cell-resolution-map-of-mouse) to see if other modifications should be made to the scCATCH predictions:
```{r, marker_gene_check, fig.show='hold'}
# Plot other markers/features to assist with identification ---------------
# spot check known immune markers
immune_markers = c('Cd14', 'Cd68', # macrophage marker
                   'Itgam', 'Adgre1', # Itgam=Cd11b; dendritic markers 
                   'Ly6d', 'Cd19', 'Cd79b', 'Ms4a1', # Ms4a1=CD20; B-cell markers
                   'Cd3d','Cd3e','Cd3g') # T-cell markers

immune_markers_plot = DotPlot(geo_so, features = immune_markers, assay = 'SCT') + coord_flip()
immune_markers_plot

# save to file
ggsave(filename = 'results/figures/immune_markers_sct_dot_plot.png', plot = immune_markers_plot, width = 8, height = 6, units = 'in')


# plot known cell-type markers 
other_markers = c('Sox9', 'Acan', # chondrocyte lineage (cartilage)
                  'Acta2', 'Tmem100', # myofibroblast
                  'Cd34','Thy1', #HSPC markers (hematopoetic stem=Cd34 and progenitors=Thy1) 
                  'Flt3') # dendritic pre-cursor marker

other_markers_dot_plot = DotPlot(geo_so, features = other_markers, assay = 'SCT') + coord_flip()
other_markers_dot_plot

# save to file
ggsave(filename = 'results/figures/other_markers_sct_dot_plot.png', plot = other_markers_dot_plot, width = 8, height = 6, units = 'in')

```
In the first plot, B-cell and T-cell markers seem to line up with the predictions and are limited to single clusters. However, macrophage and dendrocyte markers match to multiple clusters including some annotated with different cell types, so we can consider modifying those cluster labels. 


From the other marker genes, the patterns are less clear so we may want to test other clustering parameters and discuss the results with a researcher familiar with the expected cell types. However, we can notice that none of the muscle related markers seem to be highly expressed so we can consider holding off on labeled those cells until we are more confident in an identify label. 


Before deciding our final labels, we'll also check the percentage of mitochondrial genes to determine if there are any clusters (or sub populations) that might correspond to interesting cell death patterns (or might indicate further filtering is needed):
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval= TRUE}
# Check mitochondrial gene expression -------------------------------------
percent_mito_plot = FeaturePlot(geo_so, features='percent.mt')
percent_mito_plot

# save to file
ggsave(filename = 'results/figures/percent_umap_mito_plot.png', plot = percent_mito_plot, width = 6, height = 6, units = 'in')
```

We see that a higher % seem to be somewhat concentrated in a few places (the parts of cluster 7 and 11 that aren't as well organized on our heatmap), but since cell death might be of interest, we'd want to consider investigating this pattern further by splitting up the plots by day and/or waiting until after running initial differential expression analysis to determine if these cell populations are interesting biology or not.

# Annotate clusters

Next, we'll modify the cell type predictions and add the labels to our Seurat object to replace our clusters' numerical identities. Note: we will create a new metadata object where we join cell types. However, this will destroy the row names - which will cause a problem in Seurat - so we have to add them back. <!--- modify to have a hidden block that runs after to keep this large block intact -->

```{r, annotate_clusters}
# Annotate clusters using modified predictions ----------------------------
# First - Extract the cell types only from the predictions
celltype_annos = geo_catch@celltype %>% select(cluster, cell_type)

# Customize annotations
# update cluster 7, based on markers
celltype_annos$cell_type[c(8)] <- "Macrophage" # remember cluster 0 = first cluster in table
celltype_annos$cell_type[c(15)] <- "Hematopoetic precursor"

# update cluster 5, since cancer stem cells are unlikely
celltype_annos$cell_type[c(2,6)] <- "Stem Cell" # keep generic until can better characterize

# do the same for "muscle"
celltype_annos$cell_type[c(20)] <- "Unknown" # since can't confirm muscle, reset as unknown and revisit


# Merge cell types in but as a new table to slide into @meta.data
new_metadata = geo_so@meta.data %>% left_join(celltype_annos, by = c('integrated.sct.rpca.clusters' = 'cluster'))
rownames(new_metadata) = rownames(geo_so@meta.data) #  We are implicitly relying on the same row order!

# Replace the meta.data
geo_so@meta.data = new_metadata 

head(geo_so@meta.data)
```

**Checkpoint** : Has the metadata for your `geo_so` object been updated?

We have now added a "cell_type" column to the `meta.data` table:

![Image: Schematic after adding cell_type column.](images/seurat_schematic/Slide12.png)

## Visualise annotated clusters

Lastly, we can generate a revised UMAP plot with our descriptive cluster labels by using our updated Seurat object and providing the new `cell_type` label for the `group.by` argument:

```{r, catch_umap_plot, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 8, fig.show='hold'}
# Make a labeled UMAP plot of clusters ------------------------------------
catch_umap_plot = DimPlot(geo_so, group.by = 'cell_type', label = TRUE, reduction = 'umap.integrated.sct.rpca')
catch_umap_plot

ggsave(filename = 'results/figures/umap_integrated_catch.png', plot = catch_umap_plot, width = 10, height = 8, units = 'in')

catch_umap_condition_plot = DimPlot(geo_so, group.by = 'cell_type', split.by = 'day', label = TRUE, reduction = 'umap.integrated.sct.rpca')
catch_umap_condition_plot

ggsave(filename = 'results/figures/umap_integrated_catch_byCondition.png', plot = catch_umap_plot, width = 10, height = 8, units = 'in')
```

<!-- to add - number of cells per cluster and condition/replicate after annotation --->

# Save our progress

We'll save the scCATCH object. The Seurat object has not been changed in this module.

```{r, save_rds_hidden, echo = FALSE}
if(!file.exists('results/rdata/geo_so_sct_integrated_with_catch.rds')) {
  saveRDS(geo_so, file = 'results/rdata/geo_so_sct_integrated_with_catch.rds')
}

if(!file.exists('results/rdata/geo_catch.rds')) {
  saveRDS(geo_catch, file = 'results/rdata/geo_catch.rds')
}
```

```{r, save_rds, eval=FALSE}
# Save Seurat object and annotations --------------------------------------
saveRDS(geo_so, file = 'results/rdata/geo_so_sct_integrated_with_catch.rds')
saveRDS(geo_catch, file = 'results/rdata/geo_catch.rds')
```

# Summary

Now that we have generated reasonable annotations for our clusters, we can proceed with the step of differential expression which is essential to addressing our biological question for this experiment.
