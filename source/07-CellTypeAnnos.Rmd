# Introduction

Point out possible gaps between how single-cell data is presented versus the reality of running an analysis
E.g. Papers might report final filtering thresholds, but our process for choosing those is likely to be more iterative

General goal: Filtering out the "cells" that either were poorly measured or are either not single-cells or not cells at all

## Objectives

<!--Add specific goals for section-->

----

# Cell type predictions

More options for human samples than mouse

For mouse, we often use scCATCH

For human, if a relevant reference is available, would recommend XX tools (created by authors of Seurat)

Other tools

# Using scCATCH




# Summary

Now that we have ... 

Next steps: Differential Expression
