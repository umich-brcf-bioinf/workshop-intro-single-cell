- R and RStudio are designed to grab computer memory (RAM) when necessary
and release that memory when it's no longer needed. R does this with
  a fancy computer science technique called **garbage collection**.

- The R **garbage collector** is very good for small objects and simple 
  analyses, but  complex single-cell analysis can overwhelm it. So **don't rely
on R/RStudio's built in garbage collection and session management for 
  single-cell analysis**. Instead, do the following:

---

1. Save intermediate versions of the Seurat object as you go along using 
  `saveRDS()`. This gives you "savepoints" so if you need to backtrack, you 
  don't have to go back to the beginning.
<br/>
  2. Save ggplots into image files as you go along. Periodically clear ggplot 
objects from the R environment.
<br/>
  3. At the end of each day, wherever you are in the analysis, explicitly save 
the Seurat object and "power down" your session.
<br/>
  4. The next day, you can load the Seruat object using readRDS().
<br/>
  
  ---
  
  This simple pattern will make your code more reproducible and your RStudio 
session more reliable.
