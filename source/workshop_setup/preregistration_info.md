This workshop is targeted toward researchers who would like to better understand the analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data. By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

* Describe (at a high level) how single-cell samples are sequenced along with strengths of a few popular library preps.
* Create and interpret preliminary QC visualizations from a single-cell experiment.
* Use PCA and UMAP to create cell-type clusters.
* Execute and visualize differential expression across clusters.
* Identify marker genes and annotate clusters based on gene expression.

### More details:

* The workshop runs 9am-1pm ET for three days: 10/23-25. (Registration closes 10/16/2024.)
* The cost is $390/seat. (University of Michigan (UM) participants can pay with a UM shortcode.
* The workshop is entirely online and will be conducted over Zoom and Slack.
* Basic understanding of NGS sequencing protocols and/or familiarity with bulk RNA-Seq analysis is desirable. This workshop assumes some experience working with R/R-Studio. (Previous attendance in a Computational Foundations workshop or Software Carpentry workshop is sufficient.)  
* The workshop experience is designed to be interactive and includes a combination of lecture, live-coding, and opportunities for questions throughout.
