## Objectives
You can run Seurat and several related R libraries using 
University of Michigan's **Great Lakes** High Performance Cluster (HPC). By the 
end of this guide you will be able to:

- Use **Great Lakes** and **Open OnDemand** to start a RStudio session with 
  pre-installed Seurat libraries.
- Copy/paste content from your workstation to RStudio and back.
- Open a new browser window within an Open OnDemand session.
- Transfer files between Great Lakes and your workstation

---

## Background
You can run Seurat locally on your workstation. However, running Seurat on Great 
Lakes is a nice approach because:

- Sometimes scRNA-Seq analysis requires a LOT of memory (RAM). It's easy to ask 
  for more memory on Great Lakes and Great Lakes nodes have more memory 
  available than a typical laptop/workstation.
- From Cell Ranger to RStudio to Seurat, much of the software is pre-installed.
  Installing bioinformatics software is typically nuanced and often 
  unpleasantly complex - so having it ready is a _big win_. (Thanks to the ARC 
  team for getting all this installed!)

That said, using Great Lakes is different than using your laptop/workstation.
A few key ideas:

-  Great Lakes is provided by [UM Advanced Research Computing](https://its.umich.edu/advanced-research-computing){target="_blank"}. It is only available to folks affiliated with UM.
- Great Lakes uses **Open OnDemand** to reserve a part of the cluster to run 
  your analysis in RStudio.  
-  Great Lakes requires some setup.
-  Great Lakes is a recharge service, BUT it is heavily subsidized and extremely 
   affordable for most researchers. (Many researchers who are doing a low to 
   moderate amount of data analysis may not have to pay anything.)

---

## How to get help

-   If you have problems/questions, please don't hesitate to email us
    at:
    [bioinformatics-workshops@umich.edu](mailto:bioinformatics-workshops@umich.edu)

-   When emailing it will speed things along if you could include:
    -   Whether you are using Windows or Mac (and optionally which
        version of the OS you are using).
    - What browser you are using.
    - Whether you are on campus or using the VPN.
    - The specific text of any error messages, if applicable.

---

## What you need

1. You need a UM core-imaged workstation and a web browser.

2. You need to be on UM campus or connected to the UM VPN or Michigan Medicine 
   VPN using Cisco Secure Client. (This will require Duo 2-factor authentication.)

3. You need a user account on Great Lakes. The first time, you need to request 
   this from ARC; it can take 1-2 days to get set up:
   - see [Getting Started with the Great Lakes Cluster](https://its.umich.edu/advanced-research-computing/high-performance-computing/great-lakes/getting-started){target="_blank"} to get setup.
   - also, to save money, request the [UM Research Compute Package (UMRCP)](https://its.umich.edu/advanced-research-computing/research-computing-package){target="_blank"} to offset costs with subsidy from UM.

4. You will need enough storage space. How much depends on the experimental design and what analyses you want to do. Using    the workshop inputs as a guide:


    | Data | Storage required (Gb) |
    |------|-----------------------|
    | Total raw FASTQ file size | 546 |
    | Full Cell Ranger outputs | 8 |
    | Minimal inputs to run workshop analyses | 3 |
    | Minimal space to store outputs | 6 |
  
    If you focus on the minimal inputs and space to execute the workshop analyses, 
    10Gb is a good working number. Each user is allocated 80Gb of storage in their 
    home dir. As a new user, you can execute this tutorial from your home dir. As 
    your experiments and analyses grow, you can check your available space from the 
    command line (`homw-quota`) and request more storage from ARC as necessary. 


5. You will need data. Below, we'll show you how to download the input data used
   in the workshop, but you can adapt that to use your own data.

---

## Using Open OnDemand

Open OnDemand (OOD) connects you to the Great Lakes cluster through your web browser.
Once you've got everything you need from above, you're going to use OOD to 
launch a RStudio session.

1. If off-campus, connect to the VPN using Cisco Secure Client.

2. In your browser, go to Great Lakes Open On Demand:   
   [greatlakes.arc-ts.umich.edu](https://greatlakes.arc-ts.umich.edu){target="_blank"} and 
   login with your uniqname and password. 

3. In the menu at the top of the screen, click **Interactive Apps** and select 
   **RStudio**. ![](images/seuratOnGreatLakes/ood-interactive-apps.png)

4. The previous step will display a _launch configuration page_ with several fields, e.g.
       ![partial screen shot](images/seuratOnGreatLakes/ood-launch-config.png)
    ...
  
    Enter values below in the corresponding fields:
  
    | Field | Value |
    |-------|-------|
    | R Version | **Rtidyverse/4.4.0** |
    | RStudio version | **RStudio/2024.04.1** |
    | Slurm account | _(This is in the email from ARC)_ |
    | Partition | **standard** |
    | Number of hours | **4** <br/> _(Enough to get started, adjust if you need more time)_|
    | Number of cores | **4** |
    | Memory (GB) | **16** <br/> _(Enough to get started, ok to boost to 24 or 32 if you ever run out)_ |
    | Module commands | **load Bioinformatics r-seurat/5.1.0-R-4.4.1-c3m7yfq BPCells presto  scCATCH RglmGamPoi RDESeq2** |

5. After you've entered the values above, at the bottom of this page click **Launch**. 
   (Conveniently, the values you entered above will now be your default for 
   launching an RStudio session.) The screen will update to show Great Lakes is 
   preparing your session. 
   ![](images/seuratOnGreatLakes/ood-queue-rstudio.png){width=50%}

6. When the session is ready (usually a few seconds later), the screen will update:
   ![](images/seuratOnGreatLakes/ood-launch-rstudio.png){width=50%}
    - Drag the Compression slider all the way to the right
    - Drag Image Quality slider all the way to the right
    - Click **Launch RStudio**

7. This will open a new browser tab that contains your RStudio session:
![](images/seuratOnGreatLakes/rstudio-startup.png)

8. You may see a prompt asking permission to use the clipboard. Click **Allow**.
![](images/seuratOnGreatLakes/clipboard-permission.png){width=25%}

## Using RStudio

### Exiting

- The RStudio session will last for 4 hours (or however long you specified in 
  launch config above).
- If you close the browser window, you can click **Launch RStudio** again from
  the [Open OnDemand session page](https://greatlakes.arc-ts.umich.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sessions){target="_blank"} 
- You can end the session several ways. _Make sure your scripts and data are saved because these actions do not prompt to save or confirm; and once the session is closed it is gone for good._
  - In RStudio menu at the top, click File | Quit
  - In RStudio, click Session | Quit Session
  - In RStudio, close the RStudio window (top right X)
  ![](images/seuratOnGreatLakes/rstudio-close.png){width=25%}
  - In [Open OnDemand session page](https://greatlakes.arc-ts.umich.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sessions){target="_blank"}, click **Delete**.
  ![](images/seuratOnGreatLakes/ood-delete.png){width=50%}

### Shortcuts / copy-paste

- In the Rstudio window, you can Zoom in and out using _control +_ and _control -_. 
- Running RStudio in the browser inside the Great Lakes HPC complicates copying 
  and pasting from your computer to/from the remote session.
  - Copy-paste functionality doesn't always work perfectly. Sometimes you may 
    need to copy twice to get the content into the buffer. So check your work.
  - Within the RStudio window you can right-click to get a copy or paste context menu.
  - Keyboard shortcuts are _control C_ and _control V_. This is familliar to PC 
    users *but will take some getting used to for Mac-users*.
  - Copy and paste _mostly_ work as expected using Chrome or Edge browsers. 
    Other browsers (e.g. Safari) require extra steps:
    - Open the control panel (left side) 
    ![](images/seuratOnGreatLakes/novnc-controls.png){width=25%}
    - Select the clipboard icon.
    ![](images/seuratOnGreatLakes/novnc-controlpanel.png){width=25%}
    - Copy text into the clipboard area; within that area, use the native 
      keyboard shortcuts, i.e. control-C on PC or command-C on Mac). Close the
      control panel.
      ![](images/seuratOnGreatLakes/novnc-clipboard.png)
    - Right-click (or _control V_) to paste the contents into the console.
    ![](images/seuratOnGreatLakes/novnc-paste.png){width=50%}

- If the copy-paste pattern is too flaky or clumsy for your tastes, you can
  upgrade your experience by switching from using Open OnDemand in the browser
  to a [VNC viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/){target="_blank"}. 
  (Macs have a built in VNC viewer, but that viewer doesn't support copy/paste 
  with a Unix system.) Details on how to set this up are outside the scope
  of this guide, but [reach out](#how-to-get-help) and we can help.

---

### Open a browser

- FYI, you can launch the Firefox browser by clicking on Applications (top left) | 
  Web Browser. This will open another application tab (along the top).
  ![](images/seuratOnGreatLakes/ood-browser.png){width=50%}
- If you want to do any substantial copy/paste, we recommend you use this browser 
  window because it's more reliable to copy/paste within the session than from
  your local computer.

## Download workshop inputs

1. The Seurat inputs (cellranger triples and dbcells files) used in the 
    workshop can be installed locally. In the RStudio window, click on the 
    **Terminal** tab. The tab will be blank with a prompt that looks something 
    like this: `[YOUR_UNIQNAME@glXXXX ~]$ `

2. Paste the following block into the Terminal prompt: and hit _Enter/Return_. 
   This will take a minute or two to download and unpack the inputs.

    ```
    # download Seurat inputs --------------------------------------------------
    mkdir -p intro_scrnaseq_workshop/ISC_R
    cd intro_scrnaseq_workshop/ISC_R
    
    # Use curl to download a ~2 Gb tarball
    # We'll use evironment variables to avoid extremely long command lines
    source_url="`r workshop_vars$aws_s3_bucket`"
    source_file="`r workshop_vars$aws_s3_file`"
    curl -o workshop_isc_inputs.tgz ${source_url}/${source_file}

    # tar unpacks the tarball into directories
    tar xzvf workshop_isc_inputs.tgz

    # Since we have unpacked the tarball, we can remove it
    rm workshop_isc_inputs.tgz
    
    ls inputs
    
    ```

    The last line should show two directories:
    
    ```
    10x_cellranger_filtered_triples
    prepared_data
    ```

3. Now you can review the [workshop lessons](01-GettingStarted.html){target="_blank"}
   and execute the Seurat analyses on these input data.

## Transferring files

- Below are details on several ways to move files to or from Great Lakes.

  1. For small transfers, you can use [Open OnDemand file browser](#open-ondemand-file-browser).
  2. For large transfers, we recommend [Globus](#globus)
  3. You can also use [command line tools](#command-line-tools)  

- Note that to transfer a file to/from Great Lakes, you will need to be on the 
  campus network or on the VPN.

### Open OnDemand file browser

Open OnDemand (OOD) lets you browse your files and move small files 
(e.g. scripts or plots) between your workstation and Great Lakes using your web 
browser.

1.1 _In your workstation's  browser_, open the [OOD Dashboard](https://greatlakes.arc-ts.umich.edu/){target="_blank"}. 
    Along the top menu, click on **Files**. (Note that if you shrink the screen very small, the menu items will be hidden in a "hamburger".)
    In the dropdown menu, click **Home Directory**.
   
  ![](images/seuratOnGreatLakes/ood-files.png)
1.2 OOD will display the contents of your home directory. You can click on a 
    directory to see its contents.
    ![](images/seuratOnGreatLakes/ood-files-browse.png)
1.3 To view a plot graphic, you can click on the hamburger and then select **View**.
    This will open the plot in a new browser tab.
    ![](images/seuratOnGreatLakes/ood-files-view.png)
1.4 You can download one or more files by selecting their checkboxes and 
    clicking the **Download** button. (Note: if you select a directory and click
    **Download**, OOD will download the contents as a single zipped file.)
    ![](images/seuratOnGreatLakes/ood-files-download.png)

### Globus

To analyze your own files, we recommend transferring them to Great Lakes using 
**Globus**. 

- Globus is a fast, secure, and fault tolerant way to move files of any size.
- Globus is much better than OOD for transferring larger files like FASTQ files,
  Cell Ranger outputs, or saved Seurat data objects.
- Details on how to set up and use Globus are outside the scope of this guide, 
  but we recommend these links:
  
  - [ARC Globus page](https://documentation.its.umich.edu/node/5019){target="_blank"}
  - [ARC Video on using Globus](https://www.mivideo.it.umich.edu/media/t/1_uk9nmxsw/181860561?st=2980){target="_blank"}
  - [Globus tutorial from Reproducible Computing workshop](https://umich-brcf-bioinf.github.io/workshop-reproducible-computing/main/html/Module_transferring_data_globus.html){target="_blank"}

### Command line tools

For larger files/directories, we strongly recommend you use Globus. That said, 
if you are more comfortable with command line tools, you can transfer files 
using the **secure copy** command [scp](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/scp.1.html){target="_blank"}. 
`scp` is a lot like `cp` but it allows you to copy files across a network.

To transfer from your workstation to Great Lakes:

3.1 From you workstation terminal or command window, `cd` into the directory that 
    contains your data. 
3.2 Adjust the `scp` command below to match the correct source directory and 
    uniqname and hit _Enter/Return_ to execute.

  ```
  # Copy the SOURCE_DIR dir contents from your workstation to Great Lakes home dir
  # -r copies recursively 
  # -p preserves the file modification times
  scp -pr SOURCE_DIR YOUR_UNIQNAME@greatlakes-xfer.arc-ts.umich.edu:
  ```

3.3 The first time you run this command, you may see a prompt like the following; type **yes** and hit _Enter/Return_ to continue.

    The authenticity of host '...' can't be established.
    ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:....
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

  The command will print a warning (e.g. _Warning: Permanently added ‘SERVER_ADDRESS’ to the list of known hosts_). 
  This is fine.

3.4 When prompted, type your UM password followed by Enter/Return.

  - **Note that the server will not echo any characters when you are typing your password;*** this is ok.
  - Note that the password is case sensitive. 


3.5 You can also transfer files from Great Lakes to your workstation. From your 
    workstation terminal or command window, adjust the `scp` command 
    below to match the correct source file and uniqname and hit _Enter/Return_ 
    to execute.

  ```
  # Copy the SOURCE_FILE from Great Lakes to your current workstation dir
  scp YOUR_UNIQNAME@greatlakes-xfer.arc-ts.umich.edu:PATH/TO/SOURCE_FILE . 
  ```

3.6 When prompted, type your UM password followed by Enter/Return.

  - **Note that the server will not echo any characters when you are typing your password;*** this is ok.
  - Note that the password is case sensitive.

## Summary

- You can run Seurat on RStudio using University of Michigan's **Great Lakes** High Performance Cluster (HPC).
- Running RStudio on Great Lakes is a bit different than running it on your 
  workstation. Using Great Lakes requires some set up.
- Running on Great Lakes is a nice option because the libraries and software are
  pre-installed and you can run RStudio with as much memory as you need.  
- **Open OnDemand** (OOD) connects you to the Great Lakes cluster through your 
  web browser.
- Depending on your workstation and browser, copy/paste on RStudio can require 
  different keyboard shortcuts or different steps. 
- OOD, Globus, and command line tools are several ways to transfer files between 
  Great Lakes and your workstation
