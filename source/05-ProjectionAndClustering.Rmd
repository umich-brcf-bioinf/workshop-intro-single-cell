# Introduction

<!--Add specific goals for section-->

Point out possible gaps between how single-cell data is presented versus the reality of running an analysis
E.g. Papers might report final filtering thresholds, but our process for choosing those is likely to be more iterative

General goal: Filtering out the "cells" that either were poorly measured or are either not single-cells or not cells at all

## Objectives

# Projection and clustering

Contrast the previous dimensionality reduction/nearest neighbors clustering and plotting the cells in lower dimensionality with the cluster labels.


## Clustering

Nearest neighbors algorithm - based on similarity of expression pattern (just for genes/PCs selected)

Again, how are you defining a “cell type” or “subtype” should help with ambiguity not only with "How do I decide how many PCs to include?" but also "How do I choose a resolution for finding clusters?" (as well as evaluating in the downstream if your initial choices should be revised).


<!-- per Ho Lab - The previous version of Seurat (v3) applied a graph-based clustering approach, building upon initial strategies in the development of the initial droplet based single cell technology([Macosko et al. 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4481139/)). "Importantly, the distance metric which drives the clustering analysis (based on previously identified PCs) remains the same."

"However, approach in Seurat to partitioning the cellular distance matrix into clusters has dramatically improved. This approach was heavily inspired by recent publications which applied graph-based clustering approaches to scRNA-seq data ([Xu and Su 2015](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/12/1974/214505)) and CyTOF data ([Levine et al. 2015](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdfExtended/S0092-8674(15)00637-6)). Briefly, these methods embed cells in a graph structure - for example a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph, with edges drawn between cells with similar feature expression patterns, and then attempt to partition this graph into highly interconnected ‘quasi-cliques’ or ‘communities’." -->


```{r, eval = FALSE}
geo_so = FindNeighbors(geo_so, dims = 1:25, reduction = 'integrated.sct.cca')
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
geo_so = FindClusters(geo_so, resolution = 1, cluster.name = 'integrated.sct.cca.clusters')
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(Indets(geo_so), 5)
```

# Cluster plots

Note how dimensionality choices are carried through downstream functions.

What's different beteween PCA, tSNE, and UMAP?

Note: tSNE vs UMAP example: https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/ 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
geo_so = RunUMAP(geo_so, dims = 1:25, reduction = 'unintegrated.sct.pca', reduction.name = 'umap.unintegrated.sct.pca')
```

# Visualizing and evaluating clustering

How many clusters should I get and how do I adjust the number?

<!--- Show example of changing resolution?--->


We can check the how well the normalization and integration .

```{r, eval = FALSE}
post_integration_umap_plot_day = DimPlot(geo_so, group.by = 'day', label = FALSE, reduction = 'umap.sct.integrated.cca') + NoLegend()
ggsave(filename = 'ISC_R/results/figures/umap_integrated_sct_day.png', plot = post_integration_umap_plot_day)
```

![](./images/curriculum/umap_integrated_sct_day.png)



```{r, eval = FALSE}
post_integration_umap_plot_orig.ident = DimPlot(geo_so, group.by = 'orig.ident', label = FALSE, reduction = 'umap.sct.integrated.cca') + NoLegend()
ggsave(filename = 'ISC_R/results/figures/umap_integrated_sct_orig.ident.png', plot = post_integration_umap_plot_orig.ident)
```

![](./images/curriculum/umap_integrated_sct_orig.ident.png)



We can also evaluate cluster membership by `orig.ident` or by `day` using the `table()` function:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
table(geo_so@meta.data$orig.ident, geo_so@meta.data$integrated.sct.cca.clusters)


```


# Other approaches for visualizing scRNA-sq data

# Comparing to unintegrated data

If we had proceeded with our filtered data and only normalized our data without doing any integration, including through the dimensionality reduction and clustering steps and then labeled the cells with their sample of origin, then we would see the following for our data:

<!--Add example of UMAP / sample labels for unintegrated data from analysis folder to images-->

![](umap_comparison_sct.png)



In this plot, we ... see that while there are distinct clusters, those clusters seem to separate primarily by sample id. This suggests that without integration, these batch effects could skew the biological variability in our data. <!--move this section to end of Projection module to contrast with integrated results-->


<!-- Edit section to incorporate --->

# Rewind: Pre-integration evaluation

Prior to integration, we would like to know if there are any batch effects that carry through to the cell clusters. Most importantly, we would like to know if clusters tend to be determined by sample or condition (in this case, the day). In order to figure this out we have already run the following three commands, which we will describe in more detail later.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# DefaultAssay(geo_so) = 'RNA'

geo_so = RunPCA(geo_so, reduction.name = 'unintegrated.sct.pca')
geo_so = FindNeighbors(geo_so, dims = 1:25, reduction = 'unintegrated.sct.pca')
geo_so = FindClusters(geo_so, resolution = 0.5, cluster.name = 'unintegrated.sct.clusters')
geo_so = RunUMAP(geo_so, dims = 1:25, reduction = 'unintegrated.sct.pca', reduction.name = 'umap.unintegrated.sct.pca')
```


From this image, we can qualitatively see that some clusters seem to be driven by the original identity. We can see this even more clearly if we use `group.by = 'day'`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pre_integration_umap_plot = DimPlot(geo_so, group.by = 'day', label = FALSE, reduction = 'umap.unintegrated.sct.pca') + NoLegend()
ggsave(filename = 'ISC_R/results/figures/umap_unintegrated_sct_day.png', plot = pre_integration_umap_plot)
```
