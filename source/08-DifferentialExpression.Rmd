# Introduction

Point out possible gaps between how single-cell data is presented versus the reality of running an analysis
E.g. Papers might report final filtering thresholds, but our process for choosing those is likely to be more iterative

General goal: Filtering out the "cells" that either were poorly measured or are either not single-cells or not cells at all

<!-- regular html comment --> 
<!--Add specific goals for section-->

Per [hyperlink text](http://www.website.html) are ... either `plain text` or *italic* or **bold**.

> ## Reminder: RStudio code execution {.unlisted .unnumbered}
>
> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> is a standard shortcut in RStudio to send the current line (or selected lines) to the console. If you see `>` in the Console, then R has executed the command. If you see a `+`, this means that the command is not complete, R thinks there is more to your command. You can use the <kmd>esc</kmd> to get out of this state.

> ## Reminder: Object naming conventions {.unlisted .unnumbered}
> * Cannot start with numbers
> * Cannot include dashes
> * Cannot have spaces
> * Should not be identical to a named function
> * Dots and underscores can separate parts of names, alternatively CamelCase accomplishes this

    To learn more about statistical testing and what distributions best model the behavior of RNA-seq data, a good resource is this [EdX lecture by Rafael Irizarry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK7WKsL3c2w&feature=youtu.be) or this [lecture by Kasper Hansen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8RNvWu7pAw). Another helpful guide is this [Comparative Study for Differential Expression Analysis by Zhang et al.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0103207) from 2014.
