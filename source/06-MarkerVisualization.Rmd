# Introduction

Point out possible gaps between how single-cell data is presented versus the reality of running an analysis
E.g. Papers might report final filtering thresholds, but our process for choosing those is likely to be more iterative

General goal: Filtering out the "cells" that either were poorly measured or are either not single-cells or not cells at all

<!--Add specific goals for section-->

# Marker identification

Ensure that correct resolution is selected
```{r, eval = FALSE}
geo_so = SetIdent(geo_so, value = 'SCT_snn_res.0.4')
```

We can use `FindAllMarkers` to run comparisons between each cluster and all other cells, regardless of the experimental group. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
geo_so = PrepSCTFindMarkers(geo_so)
geo_markers = FindAllMarkers(geo_so, only.pos = TRUE)
```

Then we can write out the full results to file. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_csv(geo_markers, file = 'ISC_R/results/tables/marker_genes_0.4.csv')
```

In addition to generating the full set of marker genes, it can be useful to filter the results to highlight the top positive markers (since a positive fold-change would mean that gene is more highly expressed in the cluster compared to all other cells):
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# add code to create table of top 5 markers per cluster
geo_top5
```

If we look at the marker table, we see several columns:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(geo_top5)
```

# Summary

Now that we have ... However, marker genes alone might not be sufficient to determine cell-type or sub-type labels for our clusters so it can be helpful to other approaches.

Next steps: Cell type prediction
