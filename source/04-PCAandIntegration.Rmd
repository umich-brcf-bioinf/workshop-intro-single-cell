# Introduction 

One of our ultimate goals is to cluster the cells according to their expression profiles, and determine what cell types correspond to these clusters for the purposes of differential expression between clusters and/or between conditions within clusters.  However, across the 12 samples in our data set over 20,000 cells are assayed with approximately 21K genes measured per cell.

This means that even after filtering the data, we are working very "high-dimensional" data. High dimensional data presents two challenges: 1) the scale of the data makes analysis steps costly and slow and 2) there is likely uninteresting technical variation across our data that we want to excludes. 

In this section, we will use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data by grouping correlated features into a single dimension and excluding dimensions that are less likely to correspond to interesting biological variance.

Similar to the previous sections, the process of selecting informative dimensions in a dataset is often iterative and while a single value is likely to be reported, multiple parameter choices may have been tested.  


## Lesson motivations

- Understand why PCA is used to reduce high-dimensional single-cell data prior to integration and clustering

## Objectives

- Use the `RunPCA()` function to generate principal components for our data
- Choose an appropriate number of principal components to capture variance in our data
- Use `IntegrateLayers` to integrate across our data prior to clustering

# Dimensionality reduction

<!--Before this section - Day 1: Starting w/ Seurat, Initial QC, & Batch correction (SCtransform)-->

<!--Instruction Note: Using integrated data here and will compare to unintegrated results in next section, similar to  [here](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-021-03957-4)?-->

In addition to the "high-dimensionality" expected for single-cell data, we expect the data to be both "sparse" and "noisy". Sparse in the sense that many genes will either not be expressed or not measured in many of the cells and have zero values. Noisy due to biological variability and the practical limitations of both capture and sequencing depth [source](https://ouyanglab.com/singlecell/basic.html#a-gentle-introduction-to-dr).

> *Note on zero "inflation" of single-cell data*
>
> Single-cell data is sometimes described as "zero inflated", however work by [Svensson](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/582064v1.full) has challenged that characterization and argued that the higher number of zeros observed in scRNA-seq compared to bulk RNA-seq is more likely due to biological variance and lower sequencing saturation than technical artifacts. Work by [Choi et al. (2020)](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02103-2) support that zeros in single-cell data are due to biology but [Jiang et al. (2022)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8783472/) delves more into the "controversy" zero inflation, including common approaches for handling zeros and the downstream impacts.

For sparse, high-dimensional, _biological_ data, we expect many genes to have correlated expression as they would be impacted by the same biological process and for other genes to have either low (more noisy) or similar expression across the cell population and therefore not likely to correspond to cell-type/subtypes. 

So how do we determine what and how many genes to use before classifying cells into clusters based on their expression?

## What is PCA?

<!--- Give some context and background on PCA
- What is PCA
- Why do we use it 
--->

Principal component analysis (PCA) determines axes in high-dimensional space that capture the most variation. By definition, the PCs capture the greatest factors of heterogeneity in decreasing order in the data set [source](https://bioconductor.org/books/3.13/OSCA.basic/dimensionality-reduction.html#principal-components-analysis).

<!--- add PCA illustration here --->

### PCA example

To understand how PCA works for single-cell data, we can consider a smaller dataset measuring the expression of four genes measured in just two cells, we could plot the expression of those four genes, with data from one cell plotted on the x-axis and the second cell plotted on the y-axis.

![A simple PCA example (from HBC)](./images/curriculum/04-PCAandIntegration/HBC-PCA_2sample_genes.png)
<!--- Update plot to replace "Sample" with "cell" in figure and table --->

If we wanted to represent the most variation across the data, we would draw a diagonal line between gene B and gene C - this would represent the first principal component (PC). However, this line doesn't capture all the variance in this data as the genes also vary above and below the line, so we could draw another line (at a right angle to the first) representing the second most variation in the data - which would represent the second principal component (PC). 

![PCA gene loadings (from HBC)](./images/curriculum/04-PCAandIntegration/HBC-PCA_2sample_variation3.png)
<!--- Update plot to replace "Sample" with "cell" in figure ---> 

<!--- <Consider moving to dropdown and adding figure to show loadings> However, as we can see in the example below, genes near the end of each line are those with the greatest influence on the direction and length of the PC.-->


We'll skip the process of generating all possible PCs, but running PCA on our data will result in a score for each cell for each PC and each gene will have a weight or loading for a given PC. 

### Why PCA is useful for single-cell data

In contrast to bulk RNA-seq, where the majority of the variance in a given dataset are usually explained by the first and second PC, for single-cell data we expect that many more PCs are contributing to the overall variance. 

However, we can assume that biological processes affect multiple genes in a coordinated way. Therefore the top PCs likely represent biological structure rather than random technical or biological noise, which affects each gene independently and and we can use the top several PCs to approximate the full data set in downstream analysis ([source](https://bioconductor.org/books/3.12/OSCA/dimensionality-reduction.html#principal-components-analysis)).

This reduction in dimensionality, for example from 10,000 cells x 19,000 genes to 20 PCs, allows us to select PCs that are more likely to correspond to biological variation related to the expected cell types/subtypes and make the downstream clustering computationally feasible.

### Run PCA on our dataset

<!--- Add introduction to function, including link to documentation --->

Since PCA is sensitive to scale, we will run it on the SCT normalized assay ([reference](https://ouyanglab.com/singlecell/basic.html#pca-principal-component-analysis)). We will name the reduction in an informative way to keep them clear for us in the future. In this case, our data has not yet been integrated, but it has been SCT normalized. So we will name the reduction `unintegrated.sct.pca`. Note that `SCTTransform()` returned a set of highly variable genes, and the `RunPCA()` function will use this subset to determine the PCs and genes associated with those PCs.


```{r, run_pca, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Code block - run PCA
geo_so = RunPCA(geo_so, reduction.name = 'unintegrated.sct.pca')
geo_so
```
After running the command in the console, we should see that the `geo_so` Seurat object has been updated to add "1 dimensional reduction calculated".


We can then visualize the first several PCs using the `DimHeatmp()` function, which orders both cells and features (genes) according to their PCA scores and allows us to see some general patterns in the data. Here we will specify that the first 24 PCs be included in the figure and that 500 cells are randomly subsetted for the plot: __Note - you may need to increase your plot window size to resolve any errors regarding figure margins.___
```{r, pca_heatmap_plot}
# Code block - plot cell by gene heatmaps for first several PCs
DimHeatmap(geo_so, dims=1:24, cells=500, balanced=TRUE, reduction = 'unintegrated.sct.pca')


# note - need to use png() because this isn't a ggplot
png(filename = 'results/figures/qc_pca_heatmap.png', width = 12, height = 4, units = 'in', res = 300)
DimHeatmap(geo_so, dims=1:24, cells=500, balanced=TRUE, reduction = 'unintegrated.sct.pca')
dev.off()
```
As we scroll down in this plot, we see less and less structure in our plots indicating that no only is less variation is being represented by larger PCs overall but also that those PCs are less likely to correspond to variation of interest, e.g. corresponding to cell types/subtypes.


<!--- <Move this section to a dropdown section along with an example visualization from original version>
We can also visualize both the cell and gene features that define each principal components using Seurat provided functions [source](https://holab-hku.github.io/Fundamental-scRNA/downstream.html#perform-linear-dimensional-reduction).


We can highlight genes loaded for each dimension using using `VizDimLoadings()` or look at how cells load on the first two principal components, similarly to how we often look at samples for bulk RNA-seq, with the `DimPlot()` function, or use `DimHeatmap()`, which orders both cells and features according to their PCA scores and allows us to see some general patterns in the data:

```{r, pca_loading_plot}
# gene loadings
VizDimLoadings(geo_so, dims = 1:2, reduction = 'unintegrated.sct.pca')
ggsave(filename = 'results/figures/qc_pca_loadings.png', width = 12, height = 6, units = 'in')
```

```{r, pca_plot}
# PCA style plot for PC1 and PC2
DimPlot(geo_so, reduction = 'unintegrated.sct.pca', group.by = 'day')
ggsave(filename = 'results/figures/qc_pca_plot_unintegrated_sct_day.png', width = 7, height = 6, units = 'in')
```
--->

> #### How does Seurat use PCA scores? {.unlisted .unnumbered}
> 
> Per the [Ho Lab's materials](https://holab-hku.github.io/Fundamental-scRNA/downstream.html#perform-linear-dimensional-reduction) - "To overcome the extensive technical noise in any single feature for scRNA-seq data, Seurat clusters cells based on their PCA scores, with each PC essentially representing a ‘metafeature’ that combines information across a correlated feature set. The top principal components therefore represent a robust compression of the dataset."

## Choosing the number of significant PCs for dimensionality reduction

<!-- Section still needs to be edited more & consider adding a figure --> 
As we discussed above, we don't want to use all the PCs generated for a single cell data set but instead want to select a subset to limit the downstream steps to variation that's more likely to correspond to cell types or subtypes. So how many PCs should be used?

A good starting point for determining how many PCs to select for your single-cell analysis is to understand the "resolution" of your biological question. Is answering your biological question dependent on identifying rarer cell types or specific subtypes? Or are broader cell-types more relevant?

For this dataset, we are expecting a diversity of cell types and cell populations that mediate wound healing, but are also that are part of the aberrant transition to bone, which might be more rare in the population. So for this dataset, we might want to consider starting with more PCS rather than too few PCs to start. Again, our selection at this step might be a starting point for further iterations more than a final decision. 

<!-- Section may need more editing
Related - how important is that decision to the downstream impact (e.g. how much does changing the number of PCs change the clustering)?
--> 


### Visualizing relative contributions of each PC


One way to determine how many PCs to include is by looking at an elbow plot, which shows the percent variance explained by successive PCs. We'll use the `ElbowPlot()` function to do this, specifying that the first 50 PCs be plotted. 

```{r, elbow_plot}
# Code block - elbow plot
ElbowPlot(geo_so, ndims = 50, reduction = 'unintegrated.sct.pca')
ggsave(filename = 'results/figures/qc_sct_elbow_plot.png', width = 8, height = 8, units = 'in')
```

In this plot, we could arbitrarily choose a number along the x-axis that looks like a sharp change in the variance from one PC to the next, that is, an elbow. Of course, while that's often the recommendation in tutorials, the choice of where the point of the "elbow" is, is not always obvious, and this plot is no different. We could also try to quantify our choice.


### Using a (crude) optimization to select a starting point

Instead of choosing based on the elbow plot by sight alone, we can try to quanitfy our choice. Here we create a function to return a minimum PCs based on two possible metrics (cumulative variation or above a minium step size) and then we'll apply that function to our data:

```{r, optimal_pcs}
# Code block - Function to determine optimal PCs after RunPCA()
optimal_pcs = function(so, reduction) {
    # quantitative check for number of PCs to include
    pct = so@reductions[[reduction]]@stdev / sum(so@reductions[[reduction]]@stdev) * 100
    cum = cumsum(pct)
    co1 = which(cum > 90 & pct < 5)[1]
    co2 = sort(which((pct[1:length(pct)-1] - pct[2:length(pct)]) > .1), decreasing = T)[1] + 1
    pcs = min(co1, co2) 
    
    return(pcs)
}

# Apply function to our data
pcs = optimal_pcs(geo_so, 'unintegrated.sct.pca')
pcs
```


Again, this number is likely a starting point and may need to be revised depending on the outcome of the downstream steps. 

> #### Other more quanitative parameter selection options {.unlisted .unnumbered}
> 
> While outside the scope of this workshop, there are community efforts to develop more sophisticated methods to select an appropriate number of PCs, like the [chooseR package](https://github.com/rbpatt2019/chooseR) [findPC package](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/10/2949/6565314) or [using clustering trees](https://lazappi.id.au/posts/2017-07-19-building-a-clustering-tree/) to evaluate the stability of parameter choices.


### Visualizing our PC results

In addition to selecting a reduced number of PCs to represetn our data, we can also visualize , similarly to how we often look at samples for bulk RNA-seq using the `DimPlot()` function, with each cell plotted along the selected PCs and colored by a selected meta-data column:

```{r, pca_loading_plot}
# Code block - PCA style plot for PC1 and PC2
?DimPlot # default dims = c(1,2)

DimPlot(geo_so, reduction = 'unintegrated.sct.pca', group.by = 'orig.ident') # first label by sample
DimPlot(geo_so, reduction = 'unintegrated.sct.pca', group.by = 'day') # then label by day
ggsave(filename = 'results/figures/qc_pca_plot_unintegrated_sct_day.png', width = 7, height = 6, units = 'in') # save 
```

In the first plot with each cell labeled by the original sample name, it looks like there might be some batches but it's hard to distinguish. From the second by `day`, we can see that even after normalization there seems to be variation that corresponds more to a batch effect ralted to the day status than interesting biological variation. This suggests that clustering our data using our selected number of PCs, integration should be performed to mitigate these differences and better align our data.


# Integrate Layers


Based on our PCA plot and often a standard part of multiple sample scRNA-seq analysis, we will integrate our data across all samples. Having previously used `SCTransform()` to normalize our data select variable and now generated a PCA reduction, we can now use the `IntegrateLayers()` function to do that.

New to Seurat v5 are improvements that make selecting different integration methods much easier. The results of each alternative integration method are stored within the same `Seurat` object, which makes comparing downstream effects much easier.  So, if we wanted to run the slightly faster `RPCAIntegration` method, we would run (**but we won't here**):

```{r, integrate_layers, cache = TRUE, cache.lazy = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
### DO NOT RUN ###
geo_so = IntegrateLayers(
  object = geo_so, 
  method = RPCAIntegration, 
  orig.reduction = 'unintegrated.sct.pca',
  normalization.method = 'SCT',
  new.reduction = 'integrated.sct.rpca')
```

The Seurat v5 vignette on integrative analysis ([link](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/seurat5_integration#perform-streamlined-one-line-integrative-analysis)) provides examples of each integration method. Note, that the vignette code uses the `NormalizeData()`, `ScaleData()`, `FindVariableFeatures()` pipeline, so their `IntegrateLayers()` call does not include `normalization.method = 'SCT'`, as ours must.

Note we have specified the unintegrated reduction `unintegrated.sct.pca`, which is what `IntegrateLayers()` operates on, along with the `SCT` assay. Let's take a look to see what's different about the `Seurat` object:

> **Load integrated data**
> 
> Because the `IntegrateLayers()` function takes a while to run, we will simply load the integrated `geo_so` object from a file we have previously generated.
> 
> ```{r, eval = FALSE}
> geo_so = readRDS('/home/workshop/rcavalca/ISC_R/results/rdata/geo_so_sct_integrated.rds')
> ```
> 

```{r, preview_seurat}
# Check our updated object that we've read in from file
geo_so
```

Observe that we now have a new reduction, `integrated.sct.rpca`, which we will use downstream.


We can also confirm that our integration method has helped to correct the `Day` effects we saw in the initial PCA plots

```{r, eval=FALSE}
DimPlot(geo_so, reduction = 'integrated.sct.rpca', group.by = 'day')
ggsave(filename = 'results/figures/qc_pca_plot_integrated_sct_day.png', width = 7, height = 6, units = 'in')
```

<!--- confirmed in testing that PCA plot is updated if run on catched geo_so object --->

# Save our progress

Before we move on, let's save our updated Seurat object to file:

```{r, save_rds_hidden, echo = FALSE}
if(!file.exists('results/rdata/geo_so_sct_integrated.rds')) {
  saveRDS(geo_so, file = 'results/rdata/geo_so_sct_integrated.rds')
}
```

```{r, save_rds, eval = FALSE}
saveRDS(geo_so, file = 'results/rdata/geo_so_sct_integrated.rds')
```

> **Other integration methods**
> 
> After normalizing the data with `SCTransform()` and performed the dimension reduction with `RunPCA()`, alternatively we could also use the `CCA` integration method with:
> 
> ```{r, eval = FALSE}
> ### DO NOT RUN ###
> geo_so = IntegrateLayers(
>     object = geo_so, 
>     method = CCAIntegration, 
>     orig.reduction = 'unintegrated.sct.pca',
>     normalization.method = 'SCT',
>     new.reduction = 'integrated.sct.cca')
> ```
>
