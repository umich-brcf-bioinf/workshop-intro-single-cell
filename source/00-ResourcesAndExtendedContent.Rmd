# Workflow Overview {.unlisted .unnumbered}

# Introduction

Point out possible gaps between how single-cell data is presented versus the reality of running an analysis
E.g. Papers might report final filtering thresholds, but our process for choosing those is likely to be more iterative

General goal: Filtering out the "cells" that either were poorly measured or are either not single-cells or not cells at all

<Add specific goals for section>
